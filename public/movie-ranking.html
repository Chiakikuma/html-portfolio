<h1>My Top 3 Movies of all time</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Parasite</h2>
<p>
    Its a psychological thriller about class divisions and poverty. Despite its themes,
    its no documentary and is both stylistically beautiful and entertaining. Its an international film worth celebrating in the states.<br />
    PS. I dont remember much more than that but its an amazing experience to go into blind!
</p>
<h2>A Silent Voice</h2>
<p>
    Another non-American film haha. This one has psychological elements as well but in a more grounded way. Its a touching story
    involving themes of alienation, depression, and suicidal ideation. It resonated with me in my darkest moments and made me feel
    understood

<h2>Coraline</h2>
<p>
    Finally something from my country, but wait- it's animation! I usually prefer animation over live action because of the expressiveness
    and artistry. Coraline exemplifies this, despite being a children's movie its super creepy and features beautiful stop motion animation.
    I loved it so much as a child, I read the book as an adult and was not disappointed.
